# Alzheimer's Disease Classification

This repository contains machine learning models for classifying Alzheimer's disease using various supervised learning techniques. The dataset is preprocessed, analyzed, and evaluated using multiple classifiers.

## üìå Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing categorical and numerical feature distributions.
- **Feature Engineering**: Removing unnecessary columns, handling imbalanced data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization & Standardization using `MinMaxScaler` and `StandardScaler`.
- **Model Selection & Training**: Training multiple models and optimizing hyperparameters using `GridSearchCV`.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy comparison of models.
